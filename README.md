# Advent of Code
My little scripts for the puzzles on http://adventofcode.com/

Contained are scripts to calculate the answers to the puzzles on http://adventofcode.com/
My goal here is to try a few different languages to solve each days problem, although i already did the first 2 days in php (my current daily language)

Mostly you can execute the scripts directly usung whichever interpreter, but some languages may require compilation. Hopefully if i do those i'll add instructions inside of those tests.

Also note that these scripts do NOT represent any good practices, and are just a bit of fun :P dont you judge me.
